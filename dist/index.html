            <p>
                G'day, I am Gerard, a university student taking up BS
                Computer Science
            </p>
            <p>
                I started programming back when I was in High School, 9th
                Grade. I was introduced to programming during my computer
                subject and was immediately hooked by the thought of being
                able to make anything with computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my Web Development Journey last year, 2022, and
                have been continuing to learn more about Web Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also started to dip my toes into other technologies and
                fields outside of Web Development such as Linux, Rust,
                C/C++, and Java.
            </p>
